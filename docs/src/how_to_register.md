# How to add models to the MLJ model registry

The MLJ model registry is located in the [MLJModels.jl
repository](https://github.com/JuliaAI/MLJModels.jl). To
add a model, you need to follow these steps

- Ensure your model conforms to the interface defined above

- Raise an issue at
  [MLJModels.jl](https://github.com/JuliaAI/MLJModels.jl/issues)
  and point out where the MLJ-interface implementation is, e.g. by
  providing a link to the code.

- An administrator will then review your implementation and work with
  you to add the model to the registry
