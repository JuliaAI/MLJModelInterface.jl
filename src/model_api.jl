    MLJModelInterface.reformat(model, args...) -> data

Models optionally overload `reformat` to define transformations of
user-supplied data into some model-specific representation (e.g., from
a table to a matrix). When implemented, the MLJ user can avoid
repeating such transformations unnecessarily, and can additionally
make use of more efficient row subsampling, which is then based on the
model-specific representation of data, rather than the
user-representation. When `reformat` is overloaded,
`selectrows(::Model, ...)` must be as well (see
[`selectrows`](@ref)). Furthermore, the model `fit` method(s), and
operations, such as `predict` and `transform`, must be refactored to
act on the model-specific representions of the data.

To implement the `reformat` data front-end for a model, refer to
"Implementing a data front-end" in the [MLJ
manual](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/MLJ.jl/dev/adding_models_for_general_use/).

    MLJModelInterface.selectrows(::Model, I, data...) -> sampled_data

A model overloads `selectrows` whenever it buys into the optional
`reformat` front-end for data preprocessing. See [`reformat`](@ref)
for details. The fallback assumes `data` is a tuple and calls
`selectrows(X, I)` for each `X` in `data`, returning the results in a
new tuple of the same length. This call makes sense when `X` is a
table, abstract vector or abstract matrix. In the last two cases, a
new object and *not* a view is returned.

part of the tuple returned by `fit`.
